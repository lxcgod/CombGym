    "Each MAVE dataset is represented a set of $N$ observations, $\\set{(\\vec{x}_n,y_n)}_{n=1}^N$, where each observation consists of a sequence $\\vec{x}_n$ and a measurement $y_n$. Here, $y_n$ can be either a continuous real-valued number, or a categorical variable representing the bin in which the $n$th sequence was found. Note that, in this representation the same sequence $\\vec{x}$ can be observed multiple times, potentially with different values for $y$ due to experimental noise. Datasets with real-valued measurements $y$ are analyzed using GE regression, while datasets with categorical $y$ values are analyzed using MPA regression. Sets of measurements are denoted $\\set{y_n}$, etc., and the mean and standard deviations of sets of numbers are denoted by the functions $\\mean(\\set{\\cdot})$ and $\\std(\\set{\\cdot})$\n",

These degrees of freedom come in two flavors: gauge modes and diffeomorphic modes. Gauge modes are changes to $\\vec{\\theta}$ that do not alter the values of the latent phenotype $\\phi$. Diffeomorphic modes (Kinney & Atwal, 2014; Atwal & Kinney, 2016) are changes to $\\vec{\\theta}$ that do alter $\\phi$, but do so in ways that can be undone by transformations of the measurement process $p(y|\\phi)$ along corresponding \"dual modes\". As shown in (Kinney & Atwal, 2014), the diffeomorphic modes of linear G-P maps like those considered here will in general correspond to affine transformations of $\\phi$ (though there are exceptions at special values of $\\vec{\\theta}$). MAVE-NN fixes both gauge modes and diffeomorphic modes before providing parameter values or other access to model internals to the user, e.g. when ``model.get_theta()`` is called. \n",

    "### Predictive information\n",
    "The predictive information $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$, when computed on data not used for training, provides a measure of how strongly a G-P map predicts experimental measurements irrespective of the corresponding measurement process. To estimate this quantity we use k'th nearest neighbor (kNN) estimators of entropy and mutual information adapted from the NPEET Python package (VanSteeg, 2014). Here, the user has the option of adjusting $k$, which controls a variance/bias tradeoff. When $y$ is discrete (MPA regression), $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ is computed using the classic kNN entropy estimator (Vasicek, 1976; Kraskov et al., 2004) via the decomposition $I_\\pred[y;\\phi] = H[\\phi] - \\sum_y p(y) H_y[\\phi]$, where $H_y[\\phi]$ denotes the entropy of $p(\\phi|y)$ for fixed $y$. When $y$ is continuous (GE regression), $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ is estimated using the kNN-based KSG algorithm (Kraskov et al, 2004). This approach optionally supports a local nonuniformity correction of (Gao et al., 2014), which is important when $y$ and $\\phi$ exhibit strong dependencies, but which also requires substantially more time to compute. We emphasize that both estimates of $I_\\pred[y;\\phi]$ make no use of the measurement process $p(y|\\phi)$ inferred by MAVE-NN. "
